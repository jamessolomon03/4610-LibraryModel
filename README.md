## Scenario Description

Our relational database tracks the operations of library branches in the state of Georgia. The model surrounds the main entity of Books and catalogs individual physical copies of books. Information such as authors, genres, and suppliers, are also tracked. A single branch location has users, employees, and can put on events that authors may or may not attend. Library users have a membership to one branch, and we track their book checkouts, returns, event attendance, and various transactions. This project aims to model the operations of the library system and the relationships between different elements of the business. The tables in our database have been populated with sample data, and we have performed various SQL queries on this data to answer questions that we believe provide value to the libraryâ€™s business.
