# Scenario description
A description of the scenario that you are modeling describing it in sufficient detail that makes sense in the context of your data model. This should be reflective of your conversation with your group and instructor (if you reach out for help).

# Data Model
Include an image of the data model (PNG file). An explanation of the data model including the relationships between the entities in natural English. Simply put, what kind of data does your database support storage of and what kind of data does it not?

# Data Dictionary
The data dictionary explains the different columns in the different tables including data types and their roles. Please refer to sample present on ELC.

# Ten Queries
Include a natural language description of the query and a justification as to why each query is relevant from a managerial perspective (why would a manager be interested in the query results?). Avoid having queries that are almost identical to one another. Add the question in plain English as well as the query response (e.g., copy and paste Execute to Text) of each query. You can also use the code markdown to highlight the SQL code and copy and paste the results into the file.
To ensure the complexity of the queries some of the things that may be considered include multiple table join, traditional subquery, correlated subquery, GROUP BY, GROUP BY with
HAVING, multi condition WHERE, Built-in functions (e.g., AVG) or a calculated field, REGEXP, NOT EXISTS, and more.
You may combine some of the preceding list of features into a single query (still have to provide 10 queries). Indicate in matrix format in your report which features are covered in a query. A sample matrix is shown.

# Database information
The name of the database on the MySQL server. Each table should be populated with enough data so that the queries return a sufficient result set. All queries should be bookmarked through the use of stored procedures (take a look at the example on ELC) according to this format: TP_Qx (where x is to be replaced by the query number).
